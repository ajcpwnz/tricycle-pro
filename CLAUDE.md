## Lint & Test Before Done (MANDATORY — NONNEGOTIABLE)

After ANY code changes, you MUST run lint and test scripts for ALL affected apps/packages
and ensure they pass BEFORE declaring work complete.

- **cli**: `cd . && bash tests/run-tests.sh`

If any script fails, fix the issue. Never skip this step.

## MCP Usage (MANDATORY — NONNEGOTIABLE)

MCP servers are configured in `.mcp.json`. Use them in the appropriate contexts.
If an MCP requires a service to be running (e.g., Docker, a dev server, the database),
start that service BEFORE attempting to use the MCP.
